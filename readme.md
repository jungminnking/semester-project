All codes are based on the knowledge learned through ECON 8320 and further personal grinding with the help of AI tools.   

You can find the main code of the project in "**main_code.py**"  

A linking code to Streamlit can be found in "**stremlit_app.py**"

Check out "**github/workflows/bls-update.yml**" for Gihub Actions, updating on the first day of each month.
