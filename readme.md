All codes are based on the knowledge learned through the Python course with further personal grinding.   

You can find the main code of the project in "**main_code.py**"  

A linking code to Streamlit can be found in "**stremlit_app.py**"

Check out "**github/workflows/bls-update.yml**" for GitHub Actions, updating on the first day of each month.
